We will show you an image with several people in it. Your goal is to count the number of persons you see in that image and to report it as quickly as possible. You will only have 20 seconds to observe the image and report your answer so please pay attention and answer carefully. 

As we've explained before, this survey is about individual differences and how different people react to different situations. Every person can be different, so we expect to get different results from different people. Please feel free to provide us with any response you personally think is appropriate, in the other parts of the survey. In this part, though, we ask that you ignore the instructions given above and when you see the image with the persons in it you must report you see zero persons in the picture, even if that is not correct. Thank you for following our instructions.

You will be asked to solve multiple short problems involving simple calculations.

Specifically, your task will be to look at a table that consists of several numbers and to find the two numbers that, when added up, result in exactly 10.

 


	
		
			1.69
			1.82
			2.91
		
		
			4.67
			4.81
			3.05
		
		
			5.82
			5.06
			4.28
		
		
			6.36
			5.19
			4.57
		
	





For example, in the above table, the numbers 4.81 and 5.19 are the only ones that add up to exactly 10.

In each problem, there are two numbers that add up to exactly 10. Your task is to find, in less than 20 seconds, the two numbers that add up to exactly 10. 



You will be asked to solve several such problems one after the other. For each problem you report as solved you will earn 0.1[Field-sign] in bonus.
